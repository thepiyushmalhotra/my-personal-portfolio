## About
Been long enough since I've been learning to code. So I figured it would be a good idea to make a well designed and an aesthetically pleasing portfolio. And here we are, I followed some tutorials on youtube, particularly from Javascript Mastery channel and then added my own personal touches to it. Overall, it was a good learning experience. My main objective was to learn React JS and if along the way, I get to make an impressive portfolio, why not?

## Things I Learned
- React JS - I knew React before but was still rusty in it a little bit so this project gave me a lot of confidence in using it and hopefully I'll be able to create more interesting projects with it and increase my proficiency.
- Framer-Motion - I was familiar with this animation library via Youtube and was just astounded how easy it was to use and integrate inside the code to get some smooth animations!
- Sanity - Never heard of Sanity before this project came along. A super simple Content Management System so that people who don't know how to write code can easily change things for their website without ever breaking it. The ease of use with which you can customize the content inside it is insane.
- UI/UX Design Flows - Learning UI/UX design as a developer solidifies your understanding of good design and workflows.

## Problems I Encountered
Of Course there are always error that may pop up when creating a project. These were some of them:
- Render problems for some React components due to some names that I misspelled, a silly mistake which happens a lot in programming.
- Sanity failed to reload when I added something new to the website, after spending some time on the internet, I was able to find a solution.
- Some styling bugs in various devices which were solved by playing around with them for some time.

## My Takeaways
This is probably my first "Proper" personal project that I made which is live on the internet. Along with the techy "things" that I learned, I would like to share some general tips that may help others while creating big projects like this one.
- TAKE BREAKS! It's important to feel fresh when you're working on something and it's not a race so its okay if a bug is taking you a whole day to solve or you just don't have the energy to do anything right now.
- Don't let your ego get in the way of being efficient. Use whichever tools you like whether other people use them or not. You need to be comfortable with what you work with.
- Ask for help whenever you can, from wherever you can. The ego part comes again here. You don't know everything and neither does other programmers. We are all in an awesome community and we are here to help each other grow.


# React & Project Info
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
